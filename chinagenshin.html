I also play some Genshin Impact. I've mainly fallen out of favor with it, but I was there almost day 1 and 
definitely do more damage than you. :) </p>

I unfortunately have spent money on this game. However, my Xiao [definitely] does more damage than you (he does not).
Below is a memorial to the celebration I had with someone during the first lantern event.
I also unfortunately own a Venti Outfit. No, you may not see it. </p>
